# World_layoffs-SQL-Project
Here I have cleaned the layoff data by removing duplicates, standardizing the data and removing any rows and columns that are not required.
## Project Overview:
"This project focuses on cleaning and preparing layoff data for analysis."
## Data Cleaning
In the Data Cleaning part, we will be focussing on 4 things.

1. Remove Duplicates
2. Standardize the data
3. Handle Null values or blank values
4. Remove Rows and Columns if necessary or if they are for no use
